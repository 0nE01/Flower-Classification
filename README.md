### In our big world we have lots of flowers with each of them have their unique shape and color and we can agree on that every kind of flowers are beautiful in their own way 🌼
### As you may have guessed this repo is all about flowers 🎇
### I trained a simple model that is capable of classify flower images into 4 class :
|  classes  | 
| ------------- | 
| Daisy 🌼|
| Rose 🌹|
| Sunflower🌻 |
| Tulip 🌷|

There's plenty of things that you can learn in this repo such as:
* Learn to use different pytorch functions and methods 💪
* Learn how to classify images using pytorch ✨
* Learn Transfer Learning using pytorch 🤖
* Learn to work with image data in pytorch 📷

You can see here how well model is working

I've got 96 persend accuracy that I think is good :D

The class that model will predicate is on top right side of gif
