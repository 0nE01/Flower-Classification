In our big world we have lots of flowers with each of them have their unique shape and color and we can agree on that every kind of flowers are beautiful in their own way.
As you may have gueed this repo is all about flowers.
In this repo i trianed a simple model that is capbale of classify flower images into 4 class :
|  classes  | 
| ------------- | 
| Daisy|
| Rose|
| Sunflower|
| Tulip|

There's planty of things that you can learn in this repo such as:
* Learn to use diffrent pytorch functions and methods
* Learn how to classifiy images using pytorch
* Learn Transferlearning using pytorch 
* Learn to work with image data in pytorch

###  I used Convnext model and got almost 96 persend accuracy that you can find code and the model.
