### In our big world we have lots of flowers with each of them have their unique shape and color and we can agree on that every kind of flowers are beautiful in their own way 🌼
### As you may have guessed this repo is all about flowers 🎇
### In this repo i trained a simple model that is capable of classify flower images into 4 class :
|  classes  | 
| ------------- | 
| Daisy 🌼|
| Rose 🌹|
| Sunflower🌻 |
| Tulip 🌷|

There's plenty of things that you can learn in this repo such as:
* Learn to use different pytorch functions and methods 💪
* Learn how to classify images using pytorch ✨
* Learn Transfer Learning using pytorch 🤖
* Learn to work with image data in pytorch 📷
